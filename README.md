# tools.cli.mock-git-remote

Mock git command-line options parsing using org.clojure/tools.cli

This is an example meant to demonstrate the usage of tools.cli to build a
powerful command-line interface for applications.

Why mock git-remote?
Git is a popular command-line application and 'git remote' has sub-commands.
